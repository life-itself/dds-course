### Tidied Text with Original Language and Formatting  

#### **Section One: Metacrisis Work**  

I already have much of this covered in the other course on the Second Renaissance, so we donâ€™t need as much here. However, to give an example, we could ask:  

1. *What examples of cracks or escalating crises do you see in our society?*  
   - A classic example would be the climate crisisâ€”serious, worsening, and global.  

2. *In what ways might these crises be foundational?*  
   - How do they represent or connect to cracks in the underlying structures of our society?  

3. *In what ways could profound shifts in beingâ€”personally, collectively, and culturallyâ€”contribute to addressing these challenges or achieving new breakthroughs?*  
   - This isnâ€™t only about responding to crises; it could also be about unlocking new levels of human flourishing.  

These three questions relate to **Section One: Why Deliberately Developmental Spaces?**  

---

#### **Section Two: Domains, Maps, and Rafts**  

This section introduces a framework for thinking about **ontological growth, development, and unfolding**.  

1. *What do you think when you hear the word "ontological"?*  
   - What synonyms or alternative words come to mind?  

2. *Once we introduce the concept of domains, maps, and raftsâ€”which we should do early, since we will be reiterating it throughout the courseâ€”ask participants to think of an example of a raft, a map, and a domain.*  
   - Many people may feel unsure or confused at this point, and thatâ€™s fine. The course is designed to help them discover the meaning through engagement.

#### **Section Three: Cognitive Complexity**  

1. *Thinking about cognitive complexity, can you recall an example of cognitive development changing over time?*  
   - If you have experience with children or knowledge of developmental theory, what examples come to mind?  

2. *For waking up, can you think of examples of maps?*  
   - Have you seen examples of awakening, in your own life or in othersâ€™?

### **Bullet Summary of Questions Organized by Section**  

#### **Metacrisis Work (Why Deliberately Developmental Spaces?)**  
- What examples of cracks or escalating crises do you see in our society?  
- In what ways might these crises be foundational, representing cracks in our societal structures?  
- How could profound shifts in beingâ€”personally, collectively, or culturallyâ€”help us address these challenges or open new possibilities for human flourishing?  

#### **Domains, Maps, and Rafts**  
- What do you think when you hear the word "ontological"? What synonyms come to mind?  
- After introducing the framework, what is an example of a raft, a map, and a domain?  

#### **Cognitive Complexity and Waking Up**  
- Can you think of an example of cognitive complexity changing over time, either in children or in developmental theory?  
- Have you encountered examples of maps related to waking up, in your own life or othersâ€™?  

Let me know if youâ€™d like to refine or expand any part of this!

Okay, now I want to think of prompt questions for the participants, starting from the beginning of the course. So, regarding the Metacrisis work, I have that already largely done in the other course we have on the Second Renaissance, so I don't think we need so much there. However, just to give an example, I think we could say, what examples of cracks or of escalating crises do you see in our society? You know, one example would be classic, the climate crisis, that seems to be serious, it's getting worse, it's global. Okay, then the second question in that area would be, what ways can you see that those things might be sort of foundational, that these represent or connect to cracks in the foundations of our society? And then, third, is in what ways could you see that shifts in being, profound shifts in our being, either like kind of personally and collectively and culturally, would contribute to helping us address those challenges or achieve new breakthroughs? It might not be just in addressing challenges, it might be, for example, new levels of human flourishing. Okay, so those are the three questions that relate, I think, to section one on kind of why deliberately developmental spaces. Let's come in part two to domains, maps and rafts, that is, a framework for thinking about ontological growth and development or unfolding. So, first is, what do you think when you hear the word ontological, or what alternatives, synonyms, do you know of? It's a very simple one. Once we've introduced the concept of domains, maps and rafts, which I think we can do right at the beginning, because we want to keep reiterating it, we want to ask people to think of an example of a of an example of a raft. I wonder if it's rafts, maps and domains? That's often how people start. I wanted to invert it. Anyway, to ask people to think of a raft, maybe a map and a domain, and people probably at this point are a little bit unsure and confused, and that's okay, because we want them to be in a way that they're going to find this out during the course. Then, when we come to cognitive complexity, we ask them to think just of childhood development, if they've ever known children, and, or they know anything about developmental theory, and just give an example of cognitive complexity, development, changing. And then we can do the same for waking up, like, do they have examples of maps? Do they think of examples in their own life or in other people's lives? Okay, now, yeah, I think that's enough for now. I can think of more questions. So, could you take that list? First of all, just take the text and tidy it up using all of my original language, making no additions, but formatting it, adding paragraphs, removing filler words.
