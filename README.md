- [ ] âž•2025-01-30 some notes for materials that I could include into the course.
  - [ ] the piece from Red Hill Mining Community by Tony Parker, which is about the woman changing her view, and that should go into growing up.
  - [ ] Then there's the section from Zeldin's An Intimate History of Humanity, that could also go into growing up.
  - [ ] A Clip of Maharana Maharishi.
- [ ] âž•2025-01-30 [[Prompt questions for the course]] -- todo integrate into the overall script
- [ ] âž•2025-02-04 Look for Theo Dawson diagram (is it in FOLA) showing an individual trajectory with a lot of movement over assessments
- [ ] âž•2025-02-04 Need an example of how confusion over domains and maps etc leads to problems (especially in creating and navigating rafts)
  - [ ] Phlogiston as example from physical sciences ...
  - [ ] Maybe Martin example of combining positive psych practices (re cleaning up?) with awakening practices was useful
  - [ ] Yates/Culadasa personal example
  - [ ] [[Example of how lack of map causes problem in meditation (Mind Iluminated)]]
- [ ] Example of how waking up is not growing up (?) - example of climate crisis. (or at least does not lead to convergence on shared views of what constitutes knowledge and what that knowledge is ...)
  - [ ] Rufus' personal experiences with Finders community
  - [ ] see also Jeffrey Martin re implicit racism test
  - [ ] examples from LI daily instagram and implicit new-age-y assumption that waking up (on its own) will lead to caring differently about the world (e.g. stopping climate crisis)
