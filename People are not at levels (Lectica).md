NB: yes ... and isn't this a bit like IQ. For example, suppose we think that IQ does usefully measure some *underlying* (i.e. latent) capability that then manifests in performance in various areas. Isn't that similar for Lectica scale and cognitive complexity: ie. there is (potentially) an underlying latent/hidden of cognitive complexity capacity that is then showing up in different domains. Of course, there will be some context dependency depending on my knowledge in a given domain. But the the underlying capability sets a limit on what (level of complexity) i can ultimately attain in any given domain.
