This seems to imply that growing (cognitive/skills) complexity in key stages (as described in the left column) leads to the capacities in the other columns many of which don't seem to be that cognitive at all.

Does this mean that everything is just one domain?

Strictly, Dawson is quite cautious in her phrasing. The  title of the above table is actually:

> Reasoning about selected leadership skills in the four adult zones

Note that it is about *reasoning* about leadership skills -- not their actual performance. Nevertheless, it suggests (?) that such reasoning is a *necessary* (though not sufficient) condition for the development of those capacities/skills.
