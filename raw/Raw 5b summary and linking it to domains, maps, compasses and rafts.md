## Raw (so-so transcription)

Okay, so we've worked through this domain of cognitive complexity.

So we have a domain, we have a map, we have these phases.

And we have these detailed models and and elaborations in the general form, by Commons and Fischer and colleagues. And we also have a compass or GPS, a way of locating ourselves by assessing the cognitive  complexity with data, with people, and finally, we think we have work for both.

And finally, we have practices that will help to develop and improve.

There's this work of the Theo Dawson and vCol-ing (virtuous cycles of leraning). Ways of building up the skills. Once you identify these building blocks, you can work on developing them quite rapidly, and quite specifically. So, that's the approach there.

That's how it goes back to domains, maps and rafts.

## ðŸ¤– Synthesis

This provides a structured approach for policy development and education improvement, grounded in developmental models. Here's a summary of the key ideas:

1. **Frameworks and Maps for Development:**  
   Drawing from models like Commons' **Model of Hierarchical Complexity** and Fischer's **Dynamic Skill Theory**, you have a way of mapping developmental phases and assessing progress. These frameworks allow for precise evaluation of policy and individual capacities, using data-driven insights to locate where individuals or systems stand on the developmental spectrum.

2. **Practical Applications for Skill Building:**  
   Recent advancements, such as the work of Agnus Dei, focus on breaking development into **building blocks**â€”discrete, measurable skills. Once these blocks are identified, targeted practices can be implemented to accelerate development efficiently and effectively, particularly in education and societal initiatives.

3. **Domains, Maps, and Paths:**  
   By combining these developmental models with structured maps and actionable paths (rafts), policies and education practices can evolve systematically. This involves identifying critical skills, applying practices that promote growth, and tracking measurable outcomes to ensure alignment with developmental goals.
