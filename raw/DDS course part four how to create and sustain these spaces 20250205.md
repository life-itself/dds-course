![[DDS course part four how to create and sustain these spaces 20250205.m4a]]

## Raw

 So let's now talk about how we design about how we design and sustain deliberately developmental spaces. So I think there are probably two points to make here. here so this one is introducing deliberately developmental spaces features into existing institutions and the second is creating new institutions or programs or spaces So, as we said, the liberally rental spaces are not a zero or one affair. They are, you know, it's a spectre. And so we can see adding deliberately developmental space aspect gradually even to existing spaces and environments and institutions. Now at the same time I do want to say that we got to be a little careful of what can be called mindfulness For something to be a deliberately space we have certain criteria that we set out and a little bit more mindfulness while valuable, wouldn't really make something a deliberately developmental space or much more deliberately developmental, that it might be a start, or a little bit more community service, or things like that. Now, I'm going to focus a little bit more here, less on the introduction and more and actually how we create more intensive, kind of full-on deliberately do it, a mental spaces, precisely because I'm quite interested. I think that going back to the kind of motivation at the beginning, in terms of the deepest shifts we want, creating kind of crucibles or experimental environments for ontocultural, paradigmatic evolution, it's the more full-on spaces that we're looking for and which exists much less today. And I think the most strongest example you could think of is traditional monasteries, and which I'm going to say that one of the kind of optional criteria, but one which I think is actually quite important is spaces which are more proximate to the mainstream, potentially than that, would be valuable than traditional Buddhist or Christian monastery. So let think about you know how them and so the kind of this we could think in a few ways one of which you know I'm sorry in this section I want to focus more like actually how would we make one And in this next section, we're going to talk more about the general context, like the field building, the movement building for DDS that will support them coming into existence. But for now, we think about we actually want to create a DDS. How would you do that? How would you go about doing that? And, you know, first of all, if it is going to be physically colloquial, it's either going to be online or it's going to be physical. You know, it can be both, but if you're going to have a problem, in our view, there's a limit to maybe what you can do online, though it's valuable, just because you don't have maybe the same kind of intensity, the same ability to communicate. But nevertheless, we don't think exclude the possibility of there being online deliberately developmental spaces. But for now, we're going to focus to imagine it was trying to be in person, physical. So you need a space. You need a physical space. That requires maybe capital or some other way, so that's kind of one whole area that we could come to. The second is that's probably the most important is kind of what ecology of practices do you have? What dimensions or domains are you emphasizing And And... Yeah, so I think there's a thing, so it's kind of the material dimension and there's the kind of the actual cultivating incapacity dimension. So here, I think we're really in our infancy and we can learn a lot from sharing experiences by looking at the past, at everything from monasteries to intentional communities to university programs. And I'm going to hear allow two bits of sharing and we're going to have Mark and Valerie sharing the practice of ecology has developed with the life itself. Bergerac Hub and Mark could share about like his research and examination of particularly Buddhist but other traditions. Okay, and then we'll have like questions of you know ideas sharing of how do we do that. Great. Okay, so I think that one's the outline's fairly good.

## Summary 

1. **DDS exist on a spectrum** and can be integrated into existing institutions gradually, but minor changes (e.g., adding mindfulness practices) do not constitute true DDS.  
2. **The focus here is on creating full DDS environments**‚Äîdeeply immersive spaces designed for ontocultural and paradigmatic evolution.  
3. **Physical vs. Online DDS:** While online spaces are possible, physical spaces allow for deeper engagement.  
4. **Key components of a DDS:**  
   - **Material Dimension**: Securing and funding a physical location.  
   - **Cultivation Dimension**: Developing an ecology of practices that foster deep transformation.  
5. **Learning from past models:** Monasteries, intentional communities, and university programs.  
6. **Next steps in discussion:** Practice ecology at Bergerac and insights from Buddhist traditions.  

## Designing and Sustaining Deliberately Developmental Spaces

There are two main aspects to consider when discussing how to design and sustain deliberately developmental spaces (DDS):  

1. **Introducing DDS features into existing institutions**  
2. **Creating new institutions, programs, or spaces that are deliberately developmental from the ground up**  

Deliberately developmental spaces exist on a spectrum rather than being a binary (zero or one) phenomenon. It is possible to gradually introduce DDS aspects into existing environments, institutions, and spaces.  

However, we must be cautious of what could be called "mindfulness-washing." Simply adding a little more mindfulness, while valuable, does not make a space deliberately developmental. The same applies to minor additions like increased community service‚Äîthese may be starting points but do not necessarily create a true DDS.  

That said, my primary focus here is on the second aspect: creating **intensive, full-on deliberately developmental spaces**. This is because, in terms of the deepest shifts we seek‚Äîcreating **crucibles or experimental environments for ontocultural, paradigmatic evolution**‚Äîit is these immersive spaces that are most needed and currently quite rare.  

One of the strongest historical examples is the **traditional monastery**. However, a potentially valuable variation would be spaces that are **more proximate to the mainstream** than Buddhist or Christian monasteries.  

### How Do We Actually Create a DDS?  

To structure this discussion, I will first focus on the practical steps of **creating** such a space. In the next section, we will examine the broader **field-building and movement-building efforts** that support the emergence of DDS more generally.  

If we are to create a DDS, the first fundamental question is:  
- **Is it going to be a physical or online space?**  

While online spaces can be valuable, they may lack the same **intensity and depth of communication** that in-person environments provide. That said, online DDS should not be excluded, but for now, let‚Äôs focus on **physical spaces**.  

For a **physical DDS**, two main dimensions must be considered:  

1. **The Material Dimension**  
   - A physical space is needed, which requires capital or alternative means of securing a location.  
   - Considerations include funding, infrastructure, and sustainability.  

2. **The Cultivation Dimension (Ecology of Practices)**  
   - What **practices and domains** are emphasized?  
   - How do we **develop capacity in participants**?  
   - What **rituals, structures, and rhythms** create the developmental environment?  

At this stage, we are still in the **early stages of understanding** how to best create such spaces. We can learn from a variety of sources, including:  
- **Traditional monasteries**  
- **Intentional communities**  
- **University programs**  

To explore this further, we will now hear from:  
- **Valerie**, sharing the **practice ecology** developed at the Life Itself Bergerac Hub.  
- **Mark**, discussing his **research on Buddhist and other traditions**.  

Following this, we will open a discussion for **idea sharing** and **reflection on how to create DDS** effectively.
