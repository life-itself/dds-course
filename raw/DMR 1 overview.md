Okay, so let's go back to the start here a little bit and we're going to talk about different domains that we're going to cover and illustrate with. And one of the things we're trying to point out is that domains are distinct. what you want in a domain is that a domain is not the same as another domain. So we're going to have as domains, we've got cognitive complexity. We're going to have waking up. We're going to have growing up, which is going to be kind of cultural paradigm, effective value meme, the spiral dynamics, integral colors. Waking up is to be Geoffrey Watt in Matrix. And then we're going to have cleaning up where there isn't really a very good map, which you could also call some degree of emotional intelligence. And then we are going to come to what would I do we have showing up is not really maybe there's a dimension there but it's not really one that's even very mapped but the qualities of being a leader are and yeah and maybe to some degree I think there's other kind of points to cover in general just as a kind of brainstorm here is correlations between domains for example kind of ideas of ideal leaders I take landmarks concept of ontological leadership it often involves many of these it's like a kind of aspect of egolessness in many of these things as you progress and egoistness is going to make you less reactive it going to make you in some ways you might say more woken up you going to be less more peaceful there not some ego to defend it going to maybe make you a better leader like more to make you better as a teammate it shows up in many areas so these kind of these common ideas but this idea of egolessness is a bit subtle uh you know as i point out often we think about it and even people who seem egolessness still have a bunch of mind going on with biases and other reactivity so i think it's an idea that's more elusive than or it's or at least it's at least a state that's more elusive or quality it's more elusive than we think anyway so i also want to outflow a bunch of topics which is that we've got like examples or what why why is understanding domains, maps and rafts kind of relevant and why even having a concept of domains is useful. So I think first of all this is an analogy. So when you think of chemistry, physics and biology, now we all agree that first of all these sometimes artificial decisions and sometimes they get in the way but there's also a value to them. Often the kind of techniques you use in physics are a bit bit different from the techniques used in chemistry and in biology like doing physics approaches in biology often won't be very useful you need to look at like the organism or different levels you know there's different levels of scale different kind you use math a lot more in physics use kind of practical experiments more in biology i don't know you know but that's a bit crude but the point would be that there are these different domains and there's a use of that and that often the same as here which is if you're if you don't understand if and how confusing those domains these kind of may be to problems when you try and like take physics approach to biology it might not work that well and i also want to say that kind of these breakthroughs when there are misunderstandings in it even in a given domain so there was this kind of huge breakthrough when and people realized there wasn't a phlogiston, that this idea of this substance, that fire was not an element it was a process And that when something burned something was going like the actual substance was changing but it was kind of conservation It's a famous kind of moment where phlogiston, which is this invented idea, people arise that it's not actually right, it's not relevant. And so similarly having like good domains, good clarity domains, having good maps, having good conceptual understanding of development can mean avoiding issues. So for example, I think the classic one illustrated by the example of Kuladasa is that there's quite a tendency in, I would say, more spiritual circles to think that all you need is that spiritual practice and that will sort of cure everything. I see this around mindfulness personally a lot where there's a tendency, I think, in a lot of Buddhist communities, at least in the past, maybe it's changing now, where it's like you just need to practice. You've got some issue with your dad just just meditate just practice with the meditation and i think we're increasingly realizing that maybe that doesn't work so well that there are actually different techniques needed to address for example attachment issues than would be addressed in contemplative practice like contemplation developing a certain set of skills or capacities or transformation of the being and that doesn't necessarily address you know reactivity about my dad or projections from like upset with my father figure so that that's kind of really important to see that maybe that's interesting like different different domains are kind of important and that this confusion tendency to think it's just one domain leads to problems as kuladasa found out and i think similarly we think that often waking up will mean that you grow up oh if i'm kind of someone's really advanced in a contemplative way, that means they're also kind of morally advanced or culturally, I wouldn't say advanced even, but they have a kind of, you know, for example, they won't be racist, they won't be sexist, they won't be patriarchal or something like that. And I think that actually we could see that's not really the case, that even many, you know, I think Wilbur makes this case very well, that maybe people have been enlightened in a sense for about ever since the beginning of human consciousness or before, and that doesn't mean though that they're obviously people in the stone age had modern universal human rights values um and i mean this is something that might be controversial we might say all the indigenous communities had really wide versions I have to say and we can debate about it I don think that the case I think people are somewhat idolizing the indigenous at the present time. We don't need to go into that, but that would be one point. So okay, so we can apply it, you know, and also you can look at coaching practice. it's like once you have this you have a tool of kind of under often people are sort of reinventing the wheel so there's both confusion but there's also you can now start to come like oh okay x is you know um you know x practice or is is doing this that and the other you know often people are thinking they're inventing some kind of unique things but often at the moment they're like oh they're taking something from each domain they're inventing they're kind of reinventing their own kind of linear map or structure or sort of domains i mean the example here i'll give is of aletheia coaching which has become very popular and it is a great coaching method i haven't personally done it and yet you know when you look you know the guy's like okay i've got this kind of i've got this new technique where i basically use different practices at different kind of in a way stages or different i would say domains of the practice um so i think that's when there's integral life practice. So just to mention, Alisaia Coaching, integral life practice, Landmark, Palm Village, as examples of ecologies of practice, and what they address or they don't address. Okay. And I should also mention the somatic part here. Like one of the things in, again, like practices that might work across domains, but I think the somatic is particularly relevant, maybe what we call in the cleaning up domain. I know, yeah, one other point that Martin has some good studies showing that waking up does not equal growing up or cleaning up for that matter. that's a bit of an overview of the domains maps and rafts section.
