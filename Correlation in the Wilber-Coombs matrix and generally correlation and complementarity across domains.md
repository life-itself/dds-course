The Wilber-Coombs matrix (or lattice) maps states (waking up) against stages (growing up):

### Key aspect: two *independent* dimensions of development

A key aspect of the Wilber-Coombs matrix is that any location of the matrix is allowed: i.e. states and stages are independent.  Put another way: inner development (aka ontological growth) is, at minimum, two dimensional with independent dimensions of states ("waking up") and stages ("growing up").[^1][^2]

[^1]: Of course, development is even more multi-dimensional but this was a big advance from linear developmental models that stacked waking up on top of growing up (as in early Wilber in the 70s).

### But are the two dimensions independent?

Whilst these two dimensions may be distinct, they could still be **correlated**. That is, development pathways require advance along both dimensions, at least to an extent: i.e. to grow up to a certain point you may need to have "woken up" to a certain extent or vice versa. Conversely, it is difficult or impossible to be "teal" and to still be in "gross" waking up state. 

Here's a very crude sketch of a potential correlation matrix version of Wilber-Coombs (colored by heat-mapping) showing how movement along the "waking up" and the "growing up" dimension are correlated.

## More Discussion

- The overall separation has been questioned. In particular, Terri O'Fallon has continued to argue that you can collapse these back onto uni-dimensional developmental line. See e.g. Collapse of Wilber-Coombs Matrix (2010)

[^2]: A second important point, not emphasized here so much, is that states are interpreted through stages.
