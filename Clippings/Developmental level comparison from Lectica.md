The table below shows how the levels of different developmental systems are aligned.

We have not included sentence completion tests here because research has shown that these assessments are not measures of the same dimension tapped by instruments that emerged from the [Piagetian](http://www.piaget.org/aboutPiaget.html) tradition.
