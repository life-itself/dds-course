# 6-Session Prototype Course Intro to Deliberately Developmental Spaces (DDS)

## *v1.0 ‚Äì 9 Jan 2025*

* **What**: Participate in first-run ‚ÄúIntro to DDS‚Äù course and help shape it    
* **When**: 6 sessions 5th-12th Feb 2025 (Wed to Wed excluding the weekend) 1700-1830 European / 1100-1230 US (eastern)  
* **How** to participate: this is invite-only as we are developing the material. If you‚Äôre interested get in touch.

***NB:** this course is more a chance  to explore these ideas together in a small group and **for the presenters to develop/distill this material with the benefit of a deadline and audience*** **üòâ** *(with the intention this material could then be distilled into a white paper and a more polished course). This approach is inspired by what we did at Life Itself for the first second renaissance course in Dec 2023\.*

# Overview

**Deliberately Developmental Spaces (DDSs)** are environments consciously supporting cultural and ontological development (and, at the cutting edge, experimenting and innovating in this).

These spaces focus on deliberate, conscious cultivation of inner capacities, informed by multi-dimensional models of development. They can have a wide range of foci, from advanced spiritual growth to conscious parenting experiments grounded in attachment theory.

DDSs have similarities with existing institutions ranging from Harvard Business School to Buddhist monasteries. However, they also are different, or at least offer a different frame. For example, they emphasize the inner dimensions of development, including the spiritual, far more than traditional education institutions. They differ from (some) traditional monasteries in taking a more multi-dimensional approach to development and having a greater ‚Äúlay‚Äù emphasis. Finally, these spaces are informed by rich ontological models and go beyond basic practices (e.g., mindfulness in schools), aiming for significant cultural and ontological transformation.

DDS are not uniform, and there is significant variation and experiment in form and focus. For example, while some DDSs may focus on spiritual advancement, others may center around community flourishing or education. The broader DDS lens allows us to see how diverse environments can contribute to the learning and practices necessary for cultural and ontological innovation.

# Course Outline	

**Session 1: \[Metacrisis motivation\]  Why do we want them?  Why do we desire cultural and ontological innovation?**

* Introduction to the concept of cultural and ontological innovation.  
* Why traditional institutions fall short in addressing deeper developmental needs.  
* Case for urgency: societal challenges and the need for innovation in human development.

**Session 2: \[Domain, Maps, Rafts\]  What is ontological and cultural ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù? Theoretical frameworks and key terminology.**

* Exploration of multi-dimensional models of development.  
* Key theoretical underpinnings (e.g., spiritual, psychological, and social frameworks).  
* Examples from Ramana Maharishi, Lester Levinson, and attachment theory.

**Session 3: What Are Deliberately Developmental Spaces (DDSs)?**

* **Existing examples and analogies**: Case studies and inspiration from diverse domains.  
* **What makes a Deliberately Developmental Space different**: Characteristics, goals, practices and distinguishing features.  
* **Defining DDSs** and their core principles: conscious cultivation, innovation in techniques, and deeper engagement.

**Session 4: How to create and sustain DDSs**

* Practical guidance for initiating and supporting these environments  
* Ecologies of practices for example the praxis ecology developed at the Life Itself Bergerac Hub by Valerie.  
* Key questions to consider

**Session 5: How do we build a field/network**? 

* We'd like to see DDS‚Äôs network together, exchanging knowledge, exchanging learnings etc across the broader network of DDS.  
* Sharing knowledge, methods, and learnings among spaces.  
* Vision for a broader impact: connecting diverse spaces under a unified lens.

**Session 6: Broader Lens, Applications and Future Directions**

* **Ecumenical vision**: Ecumenical vision: there are many different forms of DDS and whilst we can identify a core for this specific emerging field we can also use the DDS as a lens to look at the wider field of educational environments.

* Applying the DDS framework to fields like education, parenting, public health, politics and academia community building.  
* Envisioning the future: how DDSs can transform culture and society.

*Conclusion: We need new cultural experiments, and those that are both developmental and integrative. They‚Äôre not just developing the individual; they‚Äôre integrating. They‚Äôre cultivating wisdom. They‚Äôre also cultivating a deeper relationship to life. They‚Äôre about integrating the mind, body, and spirit. We need cultural experiments that are transformative. We need them for our own lives and society at large.*
