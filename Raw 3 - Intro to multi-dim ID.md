This section aims to present an overview of multidimensional development, emphasizing its plausibility and relevance while avoiding rigorous elaboration of specific models. The central idea is that development is not a single, linear process but encompasses multiple domains, including several less emphasized in classical scientific and academic literature.

### Key Points:

1. **Is There Such a Thing as Development?**  
   Development implies movement between "locations" or stages, often described in terms of sequences or pathways. This includes foundational questions about the existence of development itself, its structure, and whether it is linear, multidimensional, or shaped by independent factors.

2. **Core Domains of Development:**  
   Drawing on integral frameworks such as Ken Wilber’s, the main dimensions of development are:  
   - **Waking Up:** Spiritual and existential awakening, recognizing deeper realities of being.  
   - **Cleaning Up:** Psychological and emotional healing, addressing shadows and unresolved issues.  
   - **Growing Up:** Cognitive, moral, and relational maturity, often linked to personal and cultural stage theories.  
   - **Showing Up:** Engagement with the world through responsibility, action, and contribution.  

3. **Augmenting the Framework:**  
   Beyond these four domains, additional dimensions such as **cognitive complexity** (commonly emphasized in academic literature) can be incorporated. The interplay between domains—whether they are distinct or interconnected—remains a critical question. 

4. **Stage Theory and Pathways:**  
   Classic stage theories highlight linear progression, but this view can be enriched by recognizing non-linear, multidimensional movement. For example, individuals may develop unevenly across domains, achieving advanced cognitive growth while lagging emotionally or spiritually. Understanding how people "move around" between locations within these domains is essential.

This section sets the foundation for exploring how development operates across multiple dimensions, including areas traditionally neglected in mainstream discourse, and raises questions about the interconnectedness of these domains.

## Raw

In this section, we are not going to cover in rigorously any of the models that we will mention. Instead, we are trying to create an overview and an understanding of one key point, which is that development is multidimensional, and also that the broad dimensions we will set out are plausible. And they are also ones that are generally not showing up in the classic literature of the scientific or academic literature as much, except for one. And we will actually basically set out the classic integralment of the three or four domains, accounts of development. So, they are waking up, cleaning up, growing up, and showing up. We also want to start maybe by setting out how development can be seen, and also to address the question, is there such a thing as development? So, there are other topics that I should just mention. Stage theory, sequences, and a kind of linear sense of location, as we met before. And we are going to try and set out in each area the best versions we know of, of that story. And we want to add to this dimension another dimension. It's not normally actually mentioned so much by Wilbur, because it's sort of implicit. This is a bit messy. There is an agreement on the domain of development. Whether they are the same, whether they are different, whether there is some common factor, independent factors, what are the independent factors. So, for example, Wilbur doesn't have cognitive complexity, but that's a standard one in the academic literature. So, what I'm going to try and set out with this basic writing style, is a nice example of a domain where you can see, first of all, ultimately in Roth, in how people can move around. There is such a thing as development, or at least different locations that one can be in. And then there is a Roth, how people move around.
