From [[Integral Spirituality]]

> However, with repeated practice of contacting higher states, your own stages of development will tend to unfold in a much faster and easier way. There is, in fact, considerable experimental evidence demonstrating exactly that. The more you are plunged into authentic higher _states_ of consciousness—such as meditative states—the _faster_ you will grow and develop through any of the _stages_ of consciousness. It is as if higher-states training acts as a lubricant on the spiral of development, helping you to disidentify with a lower stage so that the next higher stage can emerge, until you can stably remain at higher levels of awareness on an ongoing basis, whereupon a passing state has become a permanent trait. These types of higher-states training, such as meditation, are a part of any integral approach to transformation.

> In short, you cannot skip actual _stages_, but you can accelerate your growth through them by using various types of _state_-practices, such as meditation, and these transformative practices are an important part of the Integral Approach.

NB: [[Wilber's conception of stages is not very clear i.e. what lines are stages versus stages?]]
