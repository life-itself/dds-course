Let’s move from **levels** to **lines**. Developmental lines occur in all 4 quadrants, but because we are focusing on personal development, we can look at how some of these lines appear in the Upper-Left quadrant. As we saw, there are over a dozen different multiple intelligences or developmental lines. Some of the more important include:

- the **cognitive** line (or awareness of what is)
- the **moral** line (awareness of what should be)
- **emotional** or **affective** line (the full spectrum of emotions)
- the **interpersonal** line (how I socially relate to others)
- the **needs** line (such as Maslow’s needs hierarchy)
- the **self-identity** line (or “who am I?,” such as Loevinger’s ego development)
- the **aesthetic** line (or the line of self-expression, beauty, art, and felt meaning)
- the **psychosexual** line, which in its broadest sense means the entire spectrum of Eros (gross to subtle to causal)
- the **spiritual** line (where “spirit” is viewed not just as Ground, and not just as the highest stage, but as its own line of unfolding)
- the **values** line (or what a person considers most important, a line studied by Clare Graves and made popular by Spiral Dynamics)
