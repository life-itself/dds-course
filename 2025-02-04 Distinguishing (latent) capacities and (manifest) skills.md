Wondering if useful to introduce idea and terminology for distinguishing some latent capacity.

e.g. latent capacity of cognitive complexity and manifest skill/outcome of being able to reason in a certain way, or, even more concretely plan a program at work in a certain way.

cf intelligence as some latent capacity vs manifest skill or outcome e.g. score on IQ test, or performance at work, or ability to solve a certain type of maths problem etc.
