Developed by Michael Commons and colleagues in the early 1980s, the MHC is a framework for assessing the complexity of behaviors across various domains. It posits that tasks can be organized into a hierarchy based on their complexity, with each higher-order task integrating and organizing lower-order tasks in a non-arbitrary way. The model delineates 16 stages, ranging from basic sensory and motor actions to advanced abstract reasoning and cross-paradigmatic thinking. Unlike Piagetâ€™s stages, which are tied to specific age ranges, the MHC focuses on the structure of tasks and the hierarchical organization of information, making it applicable across cultures and species.
